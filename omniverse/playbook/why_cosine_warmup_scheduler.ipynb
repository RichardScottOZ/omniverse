    "\n",
    "The warmup phase in learning rate scheduling, where the learning rate linearly\n",
    "increases from a small value to a larger value, has its own unique intuition and\n",
    "benefits. Here's an exploration of the underlying reasoning:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Practical Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Gentle Start**: Starting the training with a small learning rate allows the\n",
    "   model to make small adjustments initially. This can be beneficial if the\n",
    "   initial parameters are far from optimal, as it reduces the risk of\n",
    "   overshooting or diverging.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Adaptation to Data**: The gradual increase in learning rate allows the\n",
    "   model to adapt to the data distribution and the structure of the loss\n",
    "   landscape. This can be particularly valuable when training deep models, where\n",
    "   the loss surface can be complex and non-convex.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Acceleration of Convergence**: By gradually increasing the learning rate,\n",
    "   the warmup phase can accelerate convergence by guiding the optimizer towards\n",
    "   a good region of the loss landscape. Once the learning rate reaches its\n",
    "   maximum value, the optimizer can take larger steps to explore this region.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Compatibility with Adaptive Methods**: When used with adaptive optimization\n",
    "   methods like Adam, the warmup phase can help stabilize the moving averages of\n",
    "   gradients and squared gradients, leading to more robust optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Preventing Poor Local Minima**: By gradually increasing the learning rate,\n",
    "   the optimizer may escape shallow or poor local minima in the early stages of\n",
    "   training, enabling it to find a better solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The warmup phase in learning rate scheduling serves as a controlled and gradual\n",
    "start to the training process. By linearly increasing the learning rate, it\n",
    "helps the model adapt to the data, avoids potential pitfalls in the loss\n",
    "landscape, and sets the stage for efficient optimization. The mathematical\n",
    "formulation is simple, but it embodies a thoughtful approach to training\n",
    "dynamics, often leading to improved convergence and generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Cosine Decay Phase\n",
    "\n",
    "After the warmup phase, the learning rate multiplier follows a cosine decay\n",
    "pattern. This phase commences once the current training step $t$ is greater than\n",
    "or equal to the warmup time $t_{\\text{warmup}}$, and it continues until the\n",
    "maximum training step $t_{\\text{max}}$.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Mathematical Intuition\n",

    "1. **Gradual Reduction**: The cosine decay provides a smooth and gradual\n",

    "   suddenly drops at specific intervals, the cosine decay reduces the learning\n",
    "   rate in a more continuous manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Avoiding Local Minima**: The smooth decay helps the optimization process\n",
    "   explore the loss landscape more thoroughly. It can avoid getting stuck in\n",
    "   local minima in the early stages of training by keeping the learning rate\n",
    "   relatively high. Then, as training progresses, the learning rate decreases,\n",
    "   allowing the optimizer to converge to a local minimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Flexibility**: By controlling parameters like $\\alpha_f$ (final learning\n",

    "## Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "The plot visualizes the learning rate schedule defined by the\n",
    "`CosineAnnealingWithWarmupScheduler`. Here's what the graph illustrates:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Warmup Phase**: In the initial phase, the learning rate linearly increases\n",
    "   from 0 to the initial learning rate $\\eta\\_{\\max}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Cosine Decay Phase**: After the warmup phase, the learning rate follows a\n",
    "   cosine decay pattern, decreasing towards $\\eta\\_{\\min}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This combination of initial warmup followed by cosine decay is a common practice\n",
    "in training neural networks. It allows the model to start learning slowly and\n",
    "then follow a smooth decay, which often leads to better convergence. The\n",
    "parameters $\\eta*i$, $\\alpha_f$, $t*{\\text{warmup}}$, and $\n",
    "t\\_{\\text{max}}$\n",
    "provide flexibility in configuring the learning rate schedule according to the\n",
    "specific needs of the training process.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "Cosine annealing modifies the learning rate during training in a way that's\n",
    "inspired by the shape of the cosine function. Initially, the learning rate is\n",
    "set high, enabling rapid exploration of the parameter space. As training\n",
    "progresses, the learning rate is gradually reduced following a cosine curve.\n",
    "This helps the model to find more refined solutions by doing fine-tuning during\n",
    "later stages of training.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **intuition** behind cosine annealing involves two aspects:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**: In the initial epochs, a high learning rate\n",
    "   encourages exploring a broad region of the parameter space. As the learning\n",
    "   rate decreases, the optimizer starts to exploit local minima, fine-tuning the\n",
    "   weights.\n",
    "2. **Avoiding Saddle Points and Local Minima**: The cosine annealing schedule\n",
    "   also includes brief moments where the learning rate increases slightly, which\n",
    "   can provide the necessary \"nudge\" to help the model escape non-optimal\n",
    "   solutions.\n",
