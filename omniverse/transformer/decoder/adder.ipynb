        "Let's break down how it aligns with the principles of greedy decoding:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Greedy Decoding Principle**: Greedy decoding in sequence generation models\n",
        "   involves choosing the most probable next token at each step of the sequence\n",
        "   generation. This is done iteratively until a stopping condition is met (like\n",
        "   reaching an EOS token or a maximum length).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Implementation in Your Code**:\n",
        "\n",
        "   - The `compute_sum` function generates a sequence by repeatedly predicting\n",
        "     the next token and appending it to the input.\n",
        "   - For each iteration in `compute_sum`:\n",
        "     - The model (`model(x, pad_mask, future_mask)`) generates logits for the\n",
        "       next token based on the current sequence (`x`).\n",
        "     - `last_output = logits.argmax(-1)[:, -1].view(1, 1)` picks the most\n",
        "       probable next token (the token with the highest logit value) from the\n",
        "       logits. This is the essence of greedy decoding.\n",
        "     - This token is then appended to the sequence:\n",
        "       `x = torch.cat((x, last_output), 1)`.\n",
        "   - The process continues until the model generates an EOS token, as indicated\n",
        "     by `if last_output.item() == EOS: break`.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Evaluation Function**:\n",
        "\n",
        "   - The `evaluate` function further confirms this approach by feeding truncated\n",
        "     sequences (up to the equal sign) from the dataloader to the `compute_sum`\n",
        "     function and comparing the model's predictions to the correct answers.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Characteristics of Greedy Decoding**:\n",
        "   - Greedy decoding is computationally efficient and straightforward but may\n",

The model is still autoregressive, but there's no separate encoder to produce an intermediate representation; the \"encoding\" is effectively built into the ongoing autoregressive decoding process.\n",

But since `CrossEntropyLoss` has an `ignore_index` (now you know what they are right!), you can set it to say `16` or (default `-1` but you would need to change padding number) and tell the model that whenever the ground truth is `16`, the loss\n",

        "\n",

Here's an important thing for beginners (me), In a typical GPT-like architecture used for sequence-to-sequence tasks like this one, the model doesn't use its own predictions as input during training. Instead, it uses the original, ground-truth input sequence. This is known as \"teacher forcing.\" In teacher forcing, even if the model predicts a wrong token at some timestep, it doesn't affect the input sequence for subsequent timesteps. The model continues to get the original input sequence for the entire training epoch.\n",

However, the input for the ninth timestep would still be the ground truth sequence up to that point, regardless of what the model predicted at the eighth timestep.\n",

During inference (or generation), the model does indeed use its own previously generated tokens to produce the next token, since there is no ground truth sequence to rely on.
