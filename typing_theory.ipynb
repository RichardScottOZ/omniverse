    "   reason is due to the second condition of subtyping related to function\n",
    "   applicability.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Function Applicability Issue**: `List[int]` and `List[float]` differ in how\n",
    "   they react to certain operations. You can append a `float` to a\n",
    "   `List[float]`, but not to a `List[int]`. Therefore, passing `List[int]` where\n",
    "   `List[float]` is expected can lead to operations that are invalid for\n",
    "   `List[int]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Example Breakdown**: In the given code, appending `3.14` (a `float`) to\n",
    "   `my_list` (typed as `List[int]`) would be invalid. This invalid operation\n",
    "   would either fail or incorrectly alter the list's type integrity. The\n",
    "   subsequent operation `my_list[-1] << 5` expects an integer (due to the\n",
    "   bitwise shift operation), which would fail or behave unexpectedly if\n",

    "## Covariant?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of type generics and `TypeVar` in Python, covariance (covariant) refers to a way of defining how types can change through inheritance in a type-safe manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand covariance, it's important to first grasp the concepts of subtyping and inheritance. In object-oriented programming, a class can inherit from another class, becoming a subtype of it. For instance, if you have a class `Animal` and a class `Dog` that inherits from `Animal`, `Dog` is a subtype of `Animal`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's consider generics and `TypeVar`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `TypeVar` is a utility for defining generic types in Python. You can create a `TypeVar` with or without constraints, and it can be invariant, covariant, or contravariant.\n",
    "- A type variable is covariant if it allows a subtype relationship to be transferred from its base types to the constructed types. In simpler terms, if `Dog` is a subtype of `Animal`, and you have a generic type `Container[T]`, then `Container[Dog]` can be considered a subtype of `Container[Animal]` if `T` is defined as covariant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a basic example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from typing import TypeVar, Generic\n",
    "\n",
    "T = TypeVar('T', covariant=True)\n",
    "\n",
    "class Container(Generic[T]):\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `T` is covariant. This means if you have a function that expects `Container[Animal]`, you can safely pass `Container[Dog]` to it, because `Dog` is a subtype of `Animal`, and due to covariance, `Container[Dog]` is considered a subtype of `Container[Animal]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance is particularly useful for return types. If a method in a base class returns a type `T`, and in a derived class this method returns a subtype of `T`, this is a safe and natural use of covariance.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, covariance has its limitations and isn't suitable for all situations, especially when dealing with method arguments where contravariance might be more appropriate. Proper use of covariance in generics ensures type safety and consistency, adhering to the Liskov Substitution Principle in object-oriented design."
