    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This representation of the binary search algorithm emphasizes that it works by\n",
    "reducing the size of the problem at each step. If the target value is less than\n",
    "the middle value of the array, then the algorithm searches the left half of the\n",
    "array, and if the target value is greater than the middle value, then it\n",
    "searches the right half. If the middle value is equal to the target, then the\n",
    "search is successful, and the index of the middle value is returned. If the size\n",
    "of the array is 0, then the search is unsuccessful, and -1 is returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The search space is initially defined as the entire array, from index `L = 0`\n",
    "   to `R = len(array) - 1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The middle point `M` of the search space is defined as `M = (L + R) // 2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. We compare the value at the midpoint `M` with the target value. There are\n",
    "   three possible outcomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - If `array[M] == target`, then we have found the target at index `M` and the\n",
    "     search is complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - If `array[M] > target`, then the target must, if it exists, be in the left\n",
    "     half of the array, specifically in the range from `L` to `M - 1`, because\n",
    "     all values at and after `M` are greater than the target. We update\n",
    "     `R = M - 1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - If `array[M] < target`, then the target must, if it exists, be in the right\n",
    "     half of the array, specifically in the range from `M + 1` to `R`, because\n",
    "     all values before `M` are less than the target. We update `L = M + 1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We repeat the process until we find the target or the search space is empty\n",
    "(`L > R`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Correctness\n",
    "\n",
    "For the proof of correctness, assume that the binary search algorithm does not\n",
    "correctly find the target. This means that either the algorithm did not return\n",
    "the target when it was present in the array or returned an incorrect value when\n",
    "the target was not in the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, each step of the binary search algorithm precisely follows the sorted\n",
    "property of the array. If the target is less than the value at the midpoint, we\n",
    "know that the target, if it exists, must be in the left half. Similarly, if the\n",
    "target is greater than the value at the midpoint, it must be in the right half\n",
    "if it exists. Therefore, the algorithm correctly narrows down the search space\n",
    "at each step based on the sorted property of the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "This contradicts our assumption that the binary search algorithm does not\n",
    "correctly find the target, and thus proves that the binary search algorithm is\n",
    "correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "More formally:\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm still assuming the list indices start from 1 for the sake of simplicity.\n",
    "However, in most programming languages (including Python), they start from 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{prf:proof}\n",
    "We want to prove that the binary search algorithm correctly finds a target value\n",
    "in a sorted list or correctly reports that the target is not in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's denote the proposition $P(n)$: \"For all sorted lists of length $n$, binary\n",
    "search either finds the target or correctly reports it is not in the list.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Base Case:**\n",
    "\n",
    "For $n=1$, binary search correctly reports whether the single element is equal\n",
    "to the target. So, $P(1)$ is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inductive Step:**\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume that $P(k)$ holds for all $k$ such that $1 \\leq k < n$ (Inductive\n",
    "Hypothesis). We want to show $P(n)$ is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can write down the steps of binary search for a sorted list of length $n$ as\n",
    "follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Compute $m = \\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\rfloor$ (mid-point).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. If the target equals the $m^{th}$ element of the list, then we have found the\n",
    "   target.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. If the target is less than the $m^{th}$ element, then we recursively search\n",
    "   the left subarray of length $m-1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. If the target is greater than the $m^{th}$ element, then we recursively\n",
    "   search the right subarray of length $n-m$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both the left subarray in step 3 and the right subarray in step 4 have length\n",
    "less than $n$, so by our inductive hypothesis, our algorithm works correctly in\n",
    "these cases. Therefore, we conclude that $P(n)$ is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "This completes our induction and the proof that the binary search algorithm is\n",

    "## Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "In **[Linear Search](../linear_search/concept.md)**, even though the list is\n",
    "sorted, we still have to traverse each element until we find the target, or we\n",
    "reach the end of the list. This yields a time complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(n)$,\n",
    "with $n$ being the size of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if the list is sorted, we can leverage a strategy known as\n",
    "**[divide and conquer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divide-and-conquer_algorithm)**\n",
    "to improve our search speed significantly. This is where\n",
    "**[Binary Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm)** comes\n",
    "into play.\n",
    "\n",
    "The principle behind binary search is that we continually halve our search\n",
    "space. We begin with the whole list, then determine whether our target value is\n",
    "in the first or the second half by comparing it with the middle element. If our\n",
    "target is less than the middle element, it must lie in the first half of the\n",
    "list, so we can immediately discard the second half. Conversely, if our target\n",
    "is larger than the middle element, it must reside in the second half, and we\n",
    "discard the first half.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process continues until we either find our target or our search space is\n",
    "exhausted, i.e., there's no element left to check. Notably, with each step, we\n",
    "halve our problem size, leading to a logarithmic time complexity,\n",
    "$\\mathcal{O}(\\log n)$, making binary search significantly faster than linear\n",
    "search on large, sorted datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "A neat connection exists between binary search and the concept of a\n",
    "**[Binary Search Tree (BST)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree)**.\n",
    "In a BST, each node has a value larger than all the values in its left subtree\n",
    "and smaller than all the values in its right subtree. This is akin to how binary\n",
    "search operates, dividing the list into two halves, with one half always less\n",
    "than and the other always greater than the middle. Indeed, if you perform an\n",
    "inorder traversal of a BST (left, root, right), you retrieve the elements in\n",
    "sorted order, just as you would have them arranged for a binary search. So the\n",
    "middle number of the sorted list is the \"root\" of the BST, and the left and\n",
    "right halves of the list are the left and right subtrees of the root. This is a\n",
    "great way to visualize the process of binary search and how it operates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding these relationships and principles helps in realizing why binary\n",
    "search is so effective and where it can best be applied. It's an essential tool\n",
    "in the algorithmic toolkit of any computer scientist or software developer.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sorted Array**: We assume the input array is already sorted in ascending\n",
    "   order, and binary search is not suitable for unsorted arrays.\n",
    "2. **Unique Elements**: As mentioned, the array consists of unique elements.\n",
    "   This implies that the return index for any valid target is unique.\n",
    "3. **Deterministic**: The input array does not change during the course of the\n",
    "   algorithm, and there are no external factors affecting its content.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "The constaints/assumptions are made below, we follow the same set of assumptions\n",
    "from [LeetCode's Binary Search](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search/).\n",
    "\n",
    "- The array must be sorted in ascending order.\n",
    "- The array consists of **unique** elements of type `int` with base 10.\n",
    "- **Array Length**: The length of the array `nums` will always be in the range\n",
    "  `1 <= len(nums) <= 10^4`.\n",
    "- **Array Content**: Every element in the array, as well as the target value, is\n",
    "  guaranteed to be in the range `-10^4 <= nums[i], target <= 10^4`.\n",
    "- **Return Value**: The function should return the index of the `target` if it\n",
    "  exists in `nums` and `-1` if it doesn't.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Left + Right // 2 May Cause Overflow?\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming, when two integers are added, and the result goes beyond the\n",
    "maximum value that can be stored in that integer type, it's referred to as an\n",
    "integer overflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a 32-bit signed integer in most languages. The largest value it can\n",
    "hold is $2^{31} - 1$, because one bit is reserved for the sign. When you add two\n",
    "large numbers, their sum might exceed this value, causing an overflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's explore the mid calculation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$m = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{l + r}{2} \\right\\rfloor$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If $ l $ and $ r $ are very large (close to the maximum value for the integer\n",
    "type), their sum can overflow, even though their average (mid value) might still\n",
    "be within the valid range.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Let's take a hypothetical situation where the maximum value an integer\n",
    "can store is $15$ (in reality, this is much larger, but we're simplifying for\n",
    "the sake of illustration).\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose $l = 7$ and $r = 14$. When you add these together, you get $l + r =\n",
    "21$,\n",
    "which exceeds our hypothetical maximum value of $15$. Hence, an overflow occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if we use the safer approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$m = l + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{r - l}{2} \\right\\rfloor$$\n",
    "\n",
    "With our values, we'd get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$m = 7 + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{14 - 7}{2} \\right\\rfloor = 7 + 3 = 10$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach avoids overflow because $l$ and\n",
    "$\\left\\lfloor \\frac{r - l}{2}\n",
    "\\right\\rfloor$ will always be valid integers and\n",
    "their sum will be too.\n",
    "\n",
    "In real-world applications, this is relevant for very large arrays when using\n",
    "32-bit integers. Using 64-bit integers (like `long long` in C++ or `int64` in\n",
    "some other languages) delays the point where overflow might occur, but the\n",
    "principle remains. The alternate method for calculating mid is a safer approach\n",
    "that avoids the potential overflow issue altogether.\n",

    "### Space Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "We break down the space complexity of binary search into three parts: input,\n",
    "auxiliary and total space complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Input Space Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "Input space complexity is the space used to store the input to the problem. For\n",
    "a binary search, the input is the array or list we are searching through, and a\n",
    "target value. We do not usually consider the space taken by the inputs when\n",
    "analyzing the space complexity of an algorithm, unless the algorithm modifies\n",
    "the input in place.\n",
    "\n",
    "But if we do want to consider the input space, that is the space taken by the\n",
    "inputs, which is $\\mathcal{O}(n) + \\mathcal{O}(1) = \\mathcal{O}(n)$, where $n$\n",
    "is the length of the array and $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ is the space taken by the target\n",
    "value.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Auxiliary Space Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "Auxiliary space complexity is the extra space or the temporary space used by an\n",
    "algorithm. In the case of binary search, we only need three variables to hold\n",
    "the left, right and middle indices (`L`, `R`, `m`). These variables occupy\n",
    "constant space, so the auxiliary space complexity is $\\mathcal{O}(1)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the iterative approach, only one stack frame is used, contributing to the\n",
    "auxiliary space complexity of O(1). There is no extra allocation in each\n",
    "iteration of the while loop in terms of variables or object instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Total Space Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "Total space complexity is the sum of input and auxiliary space complexities. For\n",
    "binary search, if the input space complexity is not considered and the auxiliary\n",
    "space complexity is $\\mathcal{O}(1)$, the total space complexity of binary\n",
    "search is $\\mathcal{O}(1)$, else it is $\\mathcal{O}(n)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, the binary search algorithm is very space-efficient as it only\n",

    "Substitute $d = 0$ into $T(n) = \\Theta(n^d \\log n)$, we get\n",
    "$T(n) = \\Theta(\\log n)$, which means that the time complexity of binary search\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Repeated Substitution\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's denote the time complexity of our function as $\\mathcal{T}(n)$, where $n$\n",
    "is the number of elements being considered during a given recursive call.\n",
    "Initially, $n$ is the size of the entire list, but with each recursive call, it\n",
    "gets halved.\n",
    "\n",
    "On every recursive call to the `recursive` function, the list is divided into\n",
    "two halves, and only one half is considered for further search. Hence, the size\n",
    "of the problem is reduced to half its previous size.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the recurrence relation, let's break down the operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We calculate the middle index, which takes constant time $\\mathcal{O}(1)$.\n",
    "2. We make a decision based on the middle element, again taking $\\mathcal{O}(1)$\n",
    "   time.\n",
    "3. We make a recursive call, but only on half of the current list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Putting this into a recurrence relation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathcal{T}(n) = \\mathcal{T}\\left(\\frac{n}{2}\\right) + \\mathcal{O}(1)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a standard divide-and-conquer recurrence relation. We can solve it using\n",
    "the Master Theorem or repeated substitution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using repeated substitution:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\mathcal{T}(n) &= \\mathcal{T}\\left(\\frac{n}{2}\\right) + \\mathcal{O}(1) \\\\\n",
    "\\mathcal{T}(n) &= \\left[\\mathcal{T}\\left(\\frac{n}{4}\\right) + \\mathcal{O}(1)\\right] + \\mathcal{O}(1) \\\\\n",
    "\\mathcal{T}(n) &= \\mathcal{T}\\left(\\frac{n}{4}\\right) + 2\\mathcal{O}(1) \\\\\n",
    "\\mathcal{T}(n) &= \\mathcal{T}\\left(\\frac{n}{8}\\right) + 3\\mathcal{O}(1) \\\\\n",
    "&\\vdots \\\\\n",
    "\\mathcal{T}(n) &= \\mathcal{T}\\left(\\frac{n}{2^k}\\right) + k\\mathcal{O}(1)\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, $\\mathcal{T}\\left(\\frac{n}{2^k}\\right)$ will be $\\mathcal{T}(1)$ (i.e., a\n",
    "constant) when $\\frac{n}{2^k} = 1$ or $k = \\log n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the expansion becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathcal{T}(n) = \\mathcal{T}(1) + \\log n \\times \\mathcal{O}(1)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that $\\mathcal{T}(1)$ is a constant time, the dominating factor here is\n",
    "$\\log n$. Therefore, the time complexity is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathcal{T}(n) = \\mathcal{O}(\\log n)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Space Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "For recursive algorithms, the space complexity is often determined by the\n",
    "maximum depth of the recursion. In other words, it's based on the maximum number\n",
    "of recursive calls that are in progress at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the intuition is simple, we already established there can be a maximum of\n",
    "$\\log n$ splits, thus it follows that the recursion depth is bounded by\n",
    "$\\log n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The space complexity of a recursive binary search gets divided into three parts:\n",
    "input, auxiliary, and total space complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Input Space Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "Input space complexity is the space used to store the input to the problem. For\n",
    "binary search, the input is the array or list we are searching through, and a\n",
    "target value.\n",
    "\n",
    "In most cases, we don't consider the space taken by the inputs when analyzing\n",
    "the space complexity of an algorithm, unless the algorithm modifies the input in\n",
    "place. But if we do want to consider the input space, that's the space taken by\n",
    "the inputs, which is $\\mathcal{O}(n) + \\mathcal{O}(1) = \\mathcal{O}(n)$, where\n",
    "$n$ is the length of the array, and $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ is the space taken by the\n",
    "target value.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Auxiliary Space Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "Auxiliary space complexity is the extra space or temporary space used by an\n",
    "algorithm. In the case of recursive binary search, we still only need three\n",
    "variables to hold the left, right, and middle indices (`l`, `r`, `mid_index`).\n",
    "These variables occupy constant space, so the auxiliary space complexity is\n",
    "$\\mathcal{O}(1)$ per recursive call.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, because this is a recursive function, we also have to consider the\n",
    "space taken up by the recursion stack. In the worst-case scenario, binary search\n",
    "makes $\\mathcal{O}(\\log n)$ recursive calls, and each call adds a level to the\n",
    "stack. So, the auxiliary space complexity in this case is $\\mathcal{O}(\\log n)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that an iterative implementation of binary search would have a space\n",
    "complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(1)$, as it doesn't need additional space that grows\n",
    "with the input size. It only uses a constant amount of space to store the\n",
    "pointers and the target element.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the recursive binary search:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each time we make a recursive call, we essentially halve the input size.\n",
    "- At most, we would need to make $\\log n$ recursive calls (since we are dividing\n",
    "  by 2 each time) before we either find our target or exhaust the list.\n",
    "- Each of these calls gets pushed onto the call stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the maximum height of the call stack, and hence the space complexity\n",
    "due to the recursive calls, is $O(\\log n)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Total Space Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "Total space complexity is the sum of input and auxiliary space complexities. For\n",
    "binary search, if the input space complexity is not considered and the uses\n",
    "$\\mathcal{O}(\\log n)$ auxiliary space, the total space complexity of recursive\n",
    "binary search is $\\mathcal{O}(\\log n)$; otherwise, it is $\\mathcal{O}(n)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, the recursive binary search algorithm is still very\n",
    "space-efficient as it only requires logarithmic auxiliary space to perform the\n",
    "search, and it does not modify the input array or list.\n",
    "\n",
    "## When to use Binary Search?\n",
    "\n",
    "If we can discover some kind of **monotonicity**, for example, if `condition(k)`\n",
    "is `True` then `condition(k + 1)` is `True`, then we can consider binary search.\n",
    "\n",
    "More formally, we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "The essential precondition to apply binary search is the presence of a\n",
    "**monotonic property**. This is a property that allows us to decide which half\n",
    "of the search space should be eliminated based on the comparison between the\n",
    "target value and the value at the current index.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{prf:definition} Monotonicity\n",
    ":label: monotonicity\n",
    "\n",
    "In more formal terms, a function or sequence is said to have the property of\n",
    "monotonicity if it is either entirely non-increasing or non-decreasing. A\n",
    "function that increases monotonically does not necessarily increase constantly,\n",
    "but it does not decrease at any point. Similarly, a function that decreases\n",
    "monotonically does not necessarily decrease constantly, but it does not increase\n",
    "at any point.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A sequence or function $f$ is said to be **monotone increasing** (or\n",
    "   non-decreasing) on an interval $I$ if for all $x, y \\in I$, if $x \\leq y$,\n",
    "   then $f(x) \\leq f(y)$. In simple terms, as we move along the interval, the\n",
    "   function value does not decrease; it either increases or stays the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Similarly, a sequence or function $f$ is said to be **monotone decreasing**\n",
    "   (or non-increasing) on an interval $I$ if for all $x, y \\in I$, if\n",
    "   $x \\leq y$, then $f(x) \\geq f(y)$. That is, as we move along the interval,\n",
    "   the function value does not increase; it either decreases or stays the same.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of binary search, when the `condition` function has a monotonic\n",
    "property (either always `True` to `False`, or always `False` to `True`), it\n",
    "means that there is a clear threshold or tipping point in the sorted array that\n",
    "divides the array into two halves - the first half where the `condition`\n",
    "function is `True` and the second half where the `condition` function is `False`\n",
    "(or vice versa).\n",
    "\n",
    "That's where binary search comes into play: it allows us to effectively locate\n",
    "that threshold by iteratively narrowing down the search space. If we find that\n",
    "the `condition` is `True` for a given middle element (let's call it `mid`), we\n",
    "know that all elements on the right of `mid` will also satisfy `condition`\n",
    "(because of the monotonic property), so we can safely ignore the right half.\n",
    "Conversely, if `condition(mid)` is `False`, we can ignore the left half.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we can't establish such a monotonic property, it's difficult (or even\n",
    "impossible) to decide which half of the array to eliminate, rendering binary\n",
    "search ineffective or incorrect. Therefore, confirming the existence of this\n",
    "monotonicity is crucial before deciding to use binary search.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution (Minimize $k$, $s.t.$ condition($k$) is True)\n",
    "\n",
    "Before going into details, we see the below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{prf:remark} Finding Target and Finding First True\n",
    ":label: finding-target-and-finding-first-true\n",
    "\n",
    "Finding a target in a sorted array and finding the \"first True\" in a sorted\n",
    "Boolean array are conceptually similar because both rely on a monotonic\n",
    "condition. In the first case, the condition is \"Is the element at the current\n",
    "index greater or equal to the target?\" In the second case, it's \"Is the element\n",
    "at the current index True?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "To bridge the gap:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Consider the feasible function $f(x)$ that maps each element in the sorted\n",
    "   array to either True or False based on whether the element is greater or\n",
    "   equal to the target. This makes the problem equivalent to finding the \"first\n",
    "   True\" in a sorted Boolean array derived from $f(x)$.\n",
    "2. In both problems, once you identify an element that satisfies the condition\n",
    "   (either being the target or being True), you can be sure that no elements\n",
    "   satisfying the condition exist in the half of the array that is 'less' than\n",
    "   the current element.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of finding a specific target element $x$ in a sorted array, the\n",
    "feasible function $f(i)$ would map to True for all elements greater than or\n",
    "equal to $x$ and False for all elements less than $x$. So, if the array is\n",
    "$[1, 3, 5, 7]$ and the target is $5$, the mapped Boolean array based on $f(i)$\n",
    "would be $\\text{FFFFTTT}$, making it a sorted Boolean array. In this setup,\n",
    "\"finding the first True\" indeed corresponds to \"finding the target element.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem of finding a target number in a sorted array is a \"minimize k s.t.\n",
    "condition(k) is True\" problem because you're essentially looking for the\n",
    "smallest (left-most) index `k` where the condition \"array value at `k` is\n",
    "greater than or equal to the target\" is True.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, you're trying to find the minimum `k` such that\n",
    "`nums[k] >= target`. This can either be the first occurrence of the target in\n",
    "the array (if the target exists in the array) or the position where the target\n",
    "could be inserted to maintain the sorted order of the array (if the target does\n",
    "not exist in the array).\n",
    "\n",
    "This fits the structure of \"minimize k s.t. condition(k) is True\" because you\n",
    "are minimizing the index `k` subject to a condition (i.e., `nums[k] >= target`).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the binary search template, this is implemented as the `condition(mid)`\n",
    "function. The binary search algorithm keeps adjusting the search boundaries\n",
    "(i.e., `left` and `right`) based on whether the condition is met at the\n",
    "mid-point, and keeps narrowing down to the smallest `k` (left-most position)\n",
    "where the condition is True. This is why this problem fits into the \"minimize k\n",
