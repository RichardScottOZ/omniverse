# Type Theory, A Very Rudimentary Introduction

This is a very rudimentary introduction to type theory. It is more of a
reflection and learning experience for me than a in-depth guide.

The main reference guide I followed is
[PEP 483 - The Theory of Type Hints](https://peps.python.org/pep-0483/).

Although the reference guide is written by the authors of the python language,
the concepts of type theory, including subtype relationships and type safety,
are applicable across many programming languages, not just Python. These
principles have deep roots in computer science and are essential in
understanding static type checking in languages like Java, C#, TypeScript, and
many others.

In Java, for instance, the understanding of types and subtypes is crucial for
working with class hierarchies, interface implementation, and generics. The
concepts of polymorphism, inheritance, and interface implementation in Java all
rely on a clear understanding of type relationships.

So, learning these concepts is definitely not confined to Python. They are
fundamental to computer science and software engineering, providing a foundation
for understanding type systems in various programming languages and their role
in software design and architecture.
